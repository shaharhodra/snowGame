BEFORE YOU START:
- you need Unity 2022.3+
- you need URP SRP pipeline 14 if you use higher please import a higher support pack.

Step 1      
        - Import the VFX graph (visual graph) if you want to use particles, you can find it in the package manager, its unity system.
        - Turn few options in "URP-HighFidelity" or other profile that you use:
	       * "Opaque Texture" this will fix water it need that option for proper distortion
	       * "Depth Texture" this will fix water it need that option to render at all in play mode.
	- Optionaly use 1k or 2k shadow resolution. We used 2k.
	- Turn on HDR if it is turned off
        - at scene you have few lights and many reflection probes in deferred render scene works much faster

Step 2
Go to "URP-HighFidelity-Renderer" or version of that file that you use:
Add decal support if you want to use our decals on shoreline:
  Add Renderer Feature --> Decal --> Max Draw distance200-300
        
Step 3
Look at each aspect of the pack, visit demo scene:
